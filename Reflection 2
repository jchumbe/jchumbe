      I have added four new positions to my list,
        - A game server programmer for the company Epic games. One of the things that has attracted my attention to this job would be that it is within the gaming 
          industry, which is where I want to be working in eventually. They are also a large scale company that has 32 studios that they work out of, so if I do
          end up liking the company but want to move to different locations this would be possible.

        - Game Developer for a small company named Design with FRANK in New York. This is a small scale company with only a handful of employees.  They are working 
          on creating a house designing application that would be able to be used by everone.  The reasons why id like to work here, is that it's a small company where
          I would have more of an impact, and when it's complete it would look great on my resume, for the reasons that it would show that I have a great understanding
          on how to create a user friendly platform on which they can create their own homes.

        - Game Developer at Playcrafting. Although there isn't much on the specifics of what i'll be doing at this company, it sounds like i'll be part of the whole game 
          development process from beginning to end.  This would allow me to try out all aspects of game development to then be able to figure out what I would like to
          specialize in
