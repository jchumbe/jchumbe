    b.)
      I have added four new positions to my list,
        - A game server programmer for the company Epic games. One of the things that has attracted my attention to this job would be that it is within the gaming 
          industry, which is where I want to be working in eventually. They are also a large scale company that has 32 studios that they work out of, so if I do
          end up liking the company but want to move to different locations this would be possible.

        - Game Developer for a small company named Design with FRANK in New York. This is a small scale company with only a handful of employees.  They are working 
          on creating a house designing application that would be able to be used by everone.  The reasons why id like to work here, is that it's a small company where
          I would have more of an impact, and when it's complete it would look great on my resume, for the reasons that it would show that I have a great understanding
          on how to create a user friendly platform on which they can create their own homes.

        - Game Developer at Playcrafting. Although there isn't much on the specifics of what i'll be doing at this company, it sounds like i'll be part of the whole game 
          development process from beginning to end.  This would allow me to try out all aspects of game development to then be able to figure out what I would like to
          specialize in.  They also work on designing video games that target social impacts.

        - Game Developer at High Voltage Software.  This company is a medium sized company having had some successful games, and done some work on some bigger titles
          like Injustice gods among us, which is one of my favorite video games of all time.  And very much like the job for Playcrafting, where i'll be working on 
          character development and then also doing the coding to make the game function.

  4.)
    No questions at the time.
  5.) 
    All of the jobs on my list are in the public sector as some are major game developing companies, and others being smaller companies.  Also because i'm trying to
    go into the gaming industry, it's not common for there to be non-profit companies.
    
B.)
  1.)
    As I learn more about Computer Science, I find myself apprieciating what the field has provided for us.  The evolution and constant change in the CS field, creates
    a need to comsume and learn more, so as to not get left behind, making it a very competative field that I want to be part of.
  2.)
    I believe that the gaming industry is constantly growing, but there are some things about it that need to change, as companies are coming out with less original
    work all the time, and always making remastered versions of games, to draw out more money from thier consumers.
